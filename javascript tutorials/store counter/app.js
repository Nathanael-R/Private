  3) Using the slice() method this method seems to be the fastest for browsers

  4) Using the rest/spread operator
  const newData = [...data]
  
  5) Using the map() method
  const newData = data.map(x => x)

  //Loops
  /*
    for (const cat of cats){} when cats is an array, this means get the first item in the cats collection
    assign it to the variable cat and the run the code.  between the curly brackets
  
    map is a specialized loop for collecton and you can use it to do something to each item in a collection
    then create a new item containing the changed items
    function toUpper(string){
      return string.toUpperCase()
    }
    const cats = ['Leopard', 'Serval', 'Jaguar', 'Tiger', 'Caracal', 'Lion'];
    const upperCats = cats.map(toUpper); since the map function prints a new array you have to declare the map function under a new variable
    
    console.log(upperCats); this prints a new array with all array entries in capital letters
    in this code a fuction was passed into the map method, map calls the function once for each item in the array it then adds the return value from each function call to a new array 
    when it's done it returns the new array
    
    filter() tests each item in a collection and creates a new collection containing only items that match
    function lCat(cat){
        return cat.startsWith('L') this tells the function to note the strings in the array that start with the word 'L'
      }
      
      const cats = ['Leopard', 'Serval', 'Jaguar', 'Tiger','Caracal', 'Lion']
